    <p class="WblockTech">What is Blockchain Technology?</p>
    <p class="blockchain">Blockchain is an ownership database that needs no central issuer, controller, 
        verification or storage.
        Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult 
        or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
        A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and 
        distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a 
        new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is 
        added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by 
        multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
        Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an 
        immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
        BlockChain Technology enhance trust in both record keeping and 
        financial transactions.
        Blockchain is a suite of distributed ledger technologies that can be 
        programmed to record and track anything of value, from Financial 
        Transactions, Medical records and Land titles.
        Ledger is a complete record of a business economic activities, usually to 
        track the transfer of money and asset ownership. 
        The decentralization of information reduces the ability for data tampering
        Blockchain is a non-destructive way to track data changes over time.

    <p class="Wweb3.0"> What is web 3.0?</p>
    <p class="web3.0">Web3 refers to a potential new iteration of the internet that runs on public blockchains, the record-keeping technology best known for facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. The appeal of Web3 is that it is decentralized so that instead of users accessing the internet through services mediated by the likes of Google, Apple, or Facebook, it’s the individuals themselves who own and control pieces of the internet. Web3 does not require “permission,” meaning that central authorities don’t dictate who uses what services, nor is there a need for “trust,” referring to the idea that an intermediary does not need to facilitate virtual transactions between two or more parties. Web3 theoretically protects user privacy better as well, because it’s these authorities and intermediaries that are doing most of the data collection.
    Of course, this is all an idealized vision of Web3 sketched out by blockchain developers and boosters for the future, so it might not be so egalitarian in practice. One element of Web3 that’s gaining a lot of traction is decentralized finance, also known as Defi, which involves conducting IRL financial transactions on the blockchain without assistance from banks or the government. Meanwhile, a number of large companies and venture capital firms are already investing huge sums to build Web3, and it’s hard to imagine that their involvement wouldn’t amount to some kind of centralized power.
